## Using Grover's Algorithm to solve problems in physics

### Overview: What is Grover's Algorithm?

According to Wikipedia, Grover's Algorithm "...a quantum algorithm for unstructured search that finds with high probability the unique input to a black box function that produces a particular output value..." One unique aspect of Grover's Algorithm is that it only takes order of square root of N evaluations to find the input with high probability. Broadly speaking, Grover's Algorithm is a search algorithm that can be used to find a specific input for a specific output in relatively few evaluations.
